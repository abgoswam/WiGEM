\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this work, we have developed WiGEM, an infrastructure based technique to localize a
wireless client in an indoor environment based on the RSS
 of its transmitted packets as received on stationary sniffer devices (or APs doubling 
as sniffers). WiGEM is based on a learning-based
algorithm that can learn the parameters of a Gaussian Mixture Model
dynamically from packets captured by the sniffers.
By using dynamic packet captures for parameter
estimation, WiGEM can provide location estimates 
that are much more robust in the face of device and power level
variabilities, mobility, and changes
and reconfiguration of indoor spaces that many training-based systems
are susceptible to. The biggest advantage of WiGEM is that there is no explicit 
training phase. This saves a significant pre-deployment effort that is also
difficult to maintain and update. Performance evaluations with 
a range of different WiFi devices in two different indoor testbeds demonstrate
that WiGEM performs better than model-based techniques and at par or better than 
state-of-the-art RF map-based techniques. Of particular importance is WiGEM's
superior performance when heterogeneous devices are used and when the RF map-based
techniques have coarser training locations. 


%{\bf Infact, we showed that we can achieve accuracy that is at par with state-of-the-art
%techniques that use training to build RF-signal maps first} Thus,
%our technique not only eliminates the intensive time-consuming (often manual) training phase
%but also makes our technique scalable for large target spaces.
